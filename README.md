# Classification of Online Customers using RFM Analysis

#Project Description
In today's world, online shopping has become incredibly popular, making it a prominent trend of the 21st century. To gain more benefits from customers who shop online, companies use data analytics to investigate customer behavior. I used RFM analysis to segment customers into loyal, potential loyal, repeat, non-repeat, and churning classes. RFM analysis is a technique that segments customers based on their purchasing habits and allows for the development of strategies tailored to these groups. Additionally, RFM is based on the marketing adage that 80% of a business's revenue comes from 20% of its customers.
