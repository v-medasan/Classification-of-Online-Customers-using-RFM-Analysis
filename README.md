# Classification of Online Customers using RFM Analysis
# Project Description

In today's world, online shopping has become incredibly popular, making it a prominent trend of the 21st century. To gain more benefits from customers who shop online, companies use data analytics to investigate customer behavior. I used RFM analysis to segment customers into loyal, potential loyal, repeat, non-repeat, and churning classes. RFM analysis is a technique that segments customers based on their purchasing habits and allows for the development of strategies tailored to these groups. Additionally, RFM is based on the marketing adage that 80% of a business's revenue comes from 20% of its customers.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project was obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and can be found [here](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii). This dataset contains all the transactions that occurred in a UK-based non-store online retail, between the dates 01/12/2009- 09/12/2011. The UK- based company sells mainly unique occasion giftware.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to segment customers based on their spending habits and help classify them to help increase the profitability of the business. This will allow businesses to develop strategies to increase customer spending. 
There are three major parts to the project - 
1. Data Pre-Processing 
2. Data Modeling 
3. Classification

We will use R for the entirety of the project.
